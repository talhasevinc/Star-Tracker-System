# Star Tracker System
 Star trackers are ubiquitous spacecraft sensors that typically provide high-accuracy attitude information to the spacecraftâ€™s guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) system.

 The star tracking system interprets the star images taken from the camera on the spacecraft and finds the position of this image according to the celestial coordinate system. In the developed algorithm, pattern series formed by stars are used. The position is obtained by 
 comparing the data obtained here with the real star catalogue. The developed algorithm is sensitive to incorrect star interpretations on the image.
